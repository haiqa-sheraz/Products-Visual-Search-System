## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project aims to revolutionize online shopping through a cutting-edge visual search system for e-commerce. The system, powered by advanced AI and computer vision, enables users to effortlessly upload images of desired products, eliminating the need for precise text information. Using the multi-modal CLIP model, a variant of Vision Transformer (VIT), and Pinecone vector database, the system analyzes images, identifies visual features, and searches the catalog for visually similar items. This enhances product discovery, providing a seamless and language-free shopping experience.

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Customers struggle to efficiently find desired products due to a lack of specific details. The absence of precise textual information frustrates users and poses a potential sales hurdle for e-commerce and retail entities. To address these concerns, our project proposes an advanced visual search system driven by artificial intelligence and computer vision.

## 3. OBJECTIVES
